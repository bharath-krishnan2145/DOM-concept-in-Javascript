# Color Toggle Button Set

## Description
This project implements a simple web interface with four buttons. The first three buttons are colored (red, blue, green), and the fourth button serves as a reset button. When a user clicks on any colored button, the background color of the page changes to match that button's color, while the clicked button reverts to its default appearance. The reset button restores the initial state.

## Features
- **Colored Buttons**: Three buttons that change the background color to red, blue, or green.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button that returns the background and buttons to their original state.
